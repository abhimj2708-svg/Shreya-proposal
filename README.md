# Valentine Landing Page — "Will you be my Valentine? Shreya!"

This is a single-file landing page (index.html) that shows a romantic background, a playful "No" button that escapes, and a celebratory flow when "Yes" is chosen.

How to use
1. Save the provided `index.html` file and open it in your browser (double-click or drag to browser).
2. Try to click "No" — it will dodge you. Click "Yes" to see the chime, confetti, and modal message.

Make a sharable weblink (two easy options)

Option A — GitHub Pages (recommended)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named `valentine` (or any name).
2. Commit the `index.html` into the repository (to `main` branch).
3. In the repository settings > Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder. Save.
4. Your site will be published at: `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/valentine/`
   - Example using your login: https://abhimj2708-svg.github.io/valentine/ (replace with your repo name if different)
5. Share that link with Shreya!

Option B — Quick test with RawGit/GitHack (after pushing to GitHub)
1. After pushing `index.html` to `main`, you can use RawGit alternatives:
   - `https://raw.githack.com/<user>/<repo>/main/index.html`
2. This provides a direct HTML preview link you can share (not as permanent as Pages, but quick).

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare a GitHub repository for you (I will need repo creation permissions).
- Or give you a ready-to-paste gist and a raw.githack link.

Enjoy! 💖
